in a new repository.

what were the steps?
1. create new repo w/ Github web interface
2. start up Github Desktop and sign-in
3. clone new repo from list available
4. add a .gitignore file to the cloned repo; commit and push
5. add repo as a new vault in Obsidian
6. install Obsidian-Git plugin to the new vault
7. set options for Obsidian-Git ("git:ready" shows up in bottom bar)
8. create a new file (this one!)
    let's see what happens
	
	
9. very confused by using GIthub Desktop for cloning and I get newrepo/newrepo and the git stuff split between two directories.
    Nota Bene: cloning always makes the repo directory.
	But my confusion was about assigning the vault name.
	For sensible setup when asked for the vault name provide a functional folder name, such as "notes", or "documents", or ....
	Then when opening the vault in Obsidian choose that folder name to open, since that is the directory where the content to be shared is stored.
10. So we will save this file somewhere and start over again. Maybe rest first?
